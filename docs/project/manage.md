# Managing Projects

This page covers how to open, save, and organize projects in **VoiceScriptPlayer**.

---

## 1. Opening a Project
- Go to **File → Open Project**
- Select a `.vspx` file
- The project folder will load automatically

---

## 2. Saving Projects
- **Save (Ctrl+S):** Saves the current project state
- **Save As:** Creates a copy with a new name/location
- Auto-save is available (every X minutes)

---

## 3. Resource Management
- Add files via **Project Explorer → Add Resource**
- Supported formats:
  - Audio: `.mp3`, `.wav`
  - Video: `.mp4`, `.mov`
  - Subtitles: `.srt`
  - Images: `.png`, `.jpg`
- Files are copied into the `Media/` folder for consistency

---

## 4. Exporting & Sharing
- **Export Project** → Packages the project for sharing
- **Export Player Build** → Creates a standalone playable version
- To move projects manually, copy the entire project folder

## 5. Backup & Version Control
- Recommended: keep projects under Git or cloud storage
- Project files are text-based (`.vspx`), making them version-control friendly
