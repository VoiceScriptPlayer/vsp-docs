# Intiface Central Connection (Device Bridge Setup)

## 1. Overview
**Intiface Central** is a **device bridge program** used to control various devices.  
**VoiceScriptPlayer** integrates with Intiface to send **TCode signals**  
to devices connected via Bluetooth or USB.

> üí° Intiface is the official device hub based on **Buttplug.io**,  
> allowing multiple brands of devices to be managed through a single server.

> If your device doesn‚Äôt appear in the list, additional setup may be required within Intiface.  
> For example:  
> - **TCode devices** require manual port assignment  
> - **The Handy** requires an API key to be entered  
>  
> ‚öôÔ∏è See the [Intiface Advanced Configuration Guide](intiface_advanced.md) for details.

- You can connect multiple devices simultaneously, but some may not support parallel commands.  
- Intiface runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux,  
  while **VoiceScriptPlayer currently supports Windows only**.
