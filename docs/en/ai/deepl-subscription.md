# DeepL Subscription and API Setup Guide

## 1. Overview
[DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/) is one of the world‚Äôs leading **AI translation services**,  
used in VoiceScriptPlayer for **subtitle translation**, **automatic dialogue translation**, and **UI multilingual conversion**.  

To use DeepL in VoiceScriptPlayer, you must obtain a **DeepL API key** (either API Free or API Pro).
