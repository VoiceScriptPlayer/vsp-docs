![hailuo-editor](../images/hailuo_editor.png)

In the **Audio Editor** of VoiceScriptPlayer,  
you can synthesize speech directly from text using the Hailuo engine.  
The interface is similar to COEIROINK, allowing you to synthesize multiple lines at once  
and adjust each sentence‚Äôs timing and duration in the timeline.

### üó£Ô∏è Basic Workflow

1. **Select the TextToSpeech Engine**  
   From the dropdown menu at the top, select `Hailuo AI`.  
   If your API key is correctly registered, the connection will be established automatically.

2. **Enter Sentences**  
   Input multiple sentences in the timeline or text input box.  
   Each sentence appears as an independent block that can be freely reordered or resized.

3. **Basic Voice Settings**  

   | Setting | Description |
   |----------|-------------|
   | **Language** | Choose the language to use (Korean, Japanese, English, etc.) |
   | **Voice** | Choose a voice profile (e.g., Thoughtful Woman, Gentle Male) |
   | **Emotion** | Set tone or mood (neutral, soft, energetic, etc.) |
   | **Speed** | Controls speaking rate (default: 1.0) |
   | **Pitch** | Adjusts vocal pitch |
   | **Volume** | Adjusts overall loudness |

4. **Post-Processing Options (Optional)**  
   Fine-tune pitch, intensity, or timbre.  
   Use the pronunciation dictionary to customize how certain words or names are pronounced.  
   The ‚ÄúEffect‚Äù option allows simple effects such as echo or filters to be applied.

5. **Synthesize and Preview**  
   Press ‚ñ∂ **Play** to immediately preview the generated speech.  
   Any changes made will automatically trigger re-synthesis and update the preview.  
   The generated audio files are automatically saved in the `Asset/Sound/` folder.
