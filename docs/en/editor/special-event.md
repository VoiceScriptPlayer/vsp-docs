# Climax Tab

The **Climax Tab** manages **special trigger events** that occur during a climax or when certain conditions change.  
Currently, four fixed event types are available.  
Each event can be placed as a node on the timeline to control its trigger timing.

All events have **preset system behaviors** ‚Äî  
users cannot customize or add new types of events.  
(However, timeline nodes can be individually edited or deleted.)

## 1. Event List

![special-event-list](../images/special-event-list.png)

| Event | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Normal Climax** | The most basic climax event. Triggers at the moment of climax. |
| **Hand Stop** | Stops the stroke (device movement) right before climax. |
| **Continuous Climax** | Keeps the stroke running for a short time even after climax. |
| **Ruined Orgasm** | Stops the stroke just before climax to simulate a suppressed orgasm. |

> üí° **Note:**  
> Each event has fixed system behavior.  
> You cannot edit the internal logic, but you can customize the hotkey and rest settings individually.

## 2. Event Editor

When a special event is placed on the timeline,  
you can double-click its node to open the **Event Options Window**.  
Here, you can configure trigger conditions and post-climax behavior.
