# Loading & Saving Projects

This document explains how to **load, save, and manage projects** in **VoiceScriptPlayer**.

---

## 1. Loading a Project

Existing projects can be loaded from the **Project List (tile view)** on the main screen.  
You cannot open a new project while the editor is running ‚Äî  
please close the current editor window and return to the home screen first.

---

### üîπ How to Load a Project

1. Close the editor window and return to the **Home Screen**.  
2. In the **Project List (tiles)**, find the project you want to open.  
3. Click the **Edit button** on that project tile to open it automatically.  
4. Recently modified projects are also displayed at the top under **‚ÄúRecently Edited List.‚Äù**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:**  
> VoiceScriptPlayer cannot open multiple projects simultaneously.  
> You must close the current project before opening another one.

> üí° **Tip:**  
> Projects are saved automatically and remain listed until deleted manually.  
> You can edit titles, tags, and descriptions directly from the home screen.

---

## 2. Saving a Project

VoiceScriptPlayer allows you to save your work at any time and also supports auto-save.

| Save Method | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Save (Ctrl + S)** | Instantly saves the current project state. |

> üí° **Tip:**  
> Resource files are applied independently of the save operation.

---

## 3. Resource Management

In VoiceScriptPlayer, resources are not managed in a single ‚ÄúExplorer‚Äù-style window.  
Instead, each resource type has its own **dedicated tab** for independent management.

---

### üîπ Resource Tabs Overview

The top bar of the project window includes the following resource management tabs:

| Tab Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| üéµ [**Sound**](../editor/sound.md) | Import audio files (`.mp3`, `.wav`) and perform **subtitle generation/editing**, **translation**, and **TTS synthesis**. |
| üé¨ [**Video**](../editor/video.md) | Add video files (`.mp4`, `.mov`) and perform **subtitle generation**, **translation**, and **synchronization editing**. |
| üßç [**Live2D**](../editor/live2d.md) | Import and configure character models (`.model3.json`) and motion files. |
| üß© [**UI**](../editor/ui.md) | Arrange and edit **user interface components** such as buttons, images, and text. |
| üí¨ [**Script**](../editor/script.md) | Define and control **interactive logic** using variables, triggers, and conditionals. |
| ‚úèÔ∏è [**Stroke**](../editor/stroke.md) | Import and configure **timeline-based stroke patterns**. |
| ‚ú® [**Special Events**](../editor/special-event.md) | Provides **predefined special events** for quick use. |
| üì¶ [**Resource Management**](../editor/resources.md) | Manage **global project resources** (variables, images, Live2D assets, translation dictionaries, etc.) in one place. |

---

### üîπ Adding Resources

1. Go to the desired resource tab (e.g., **Sound**, **Video**, **Live2D**).  
2. Click the **[Import] button** at the top to add files.  
3. The resource will appear in that tab‚Äôs list and automatically be copied to the appropriate location inside the project folder.

> ‚öôÔ∏è **Note:**  
> Each resource is managed independently within its own tab.  
> Imported files are automatically organized into subfolders (e.g., `Video/`, `UI/`, `Trigger/`, etc.).  
> You do not need to specify paths manually.

---

### üîπ Editing & Deleting Resources

- Selecting a registered resource in any tab shows its **detailed settings** in the right panel.  
- Changes are applied in real time and saved automatically ‚Äî no manual saving required.  
- To remove a resource, click the **[Delete] button**.  
  (The corresponding file will also be cleaned up from the project folder.)

---

> üí° **Tip:**  
> Each resource tab works independently, so editing one resource won‚Äôt affect others.  
> For example, while editing a sound, your UI tab layout remains unchanged.

---

## 4. Exporting & Sharing

VoiceScriptPlayer allows you to distribute projects to others  
or publish them in a **playback-only format** that cannot be edited.

---

### üìÅ Open Project Publishing

![File Menu - Project Publish](../images/project-publish-menu.png)

You can access the publishing feature from the top menu via **[File ‚Üí Publish Project]**.  
Clicking this opens the publish configuration window.

---

### üóÇÔ∏è Publish Settings Window

![Project Publish](../images/project-publish.png)

In the publish window, you can configure the following options:

| Option | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Select Location** | Choose the folder path where the project will be published. |
| **Include Resources** | Select which resources to include in the published project.<br>Use the right arrow (‚Üí) to exclude or the left arrow (‚Üê) to include items. |

Once publishing is complete,  
a **read-only playable version** of the project folder will be generated in the selected location.

> ‚öôÔ∏è **Note:**  
> Projects are not compressed during publishing.  
> The internal structure (`Video/`, `UI/`, `Trigger/`, etc.) is preserved,  
> and the published project can only be run in **VoiceScriptPlayer Player**.

---

### üéß Excluding Copyrighted Audio

During publishing, copyrighted audio (e.g., commercial BGM or voice assets)  
can be excluded from the ‚ÄúInclude Resources‚Äù list.

- Excluded audio files will not be copied into the published folder.  
- During playback, users can manually specify the location of these files.  
- This allows **safe distribution of projects while protecting copyrighted materials.**

> üí° **Tip:**  
> Clean up copyrighted resources before publishing  
> so others can open and play the project without missing files or errors.

---

### üì¶ Export Options Summary

| Function | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Publish Project** | Exports a folder version ‚Äî playback only, editing disabled. |
| **Export Project** | Copies or backs up the entire project. |
| **Build Player Export** | Builds a standalone executable for full independent playback. |

---

## 5. Backup & Version Control

To ensure stability, it‚Äôs recommended to back up and version your projects regularly.

- **Recommended Folder:**  
  Organize each project into its own folder inside  
  `Documents/VoiceScriptPlayer/Projects/`.
