## 2. Configure Project Information

In the right panel, you can set the basic information for your new project.  
The following items are key options to check when creating a project:

| Item | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Project Title** | Enter the name of your project. This will also be used as the file and folder name. |
| **Product Code (DLsite Code)** | Enter the DLsite product ID, e.g., `RJ01430276`.<br>Click the **üîç button** on the right to automatically bind the product‚Äôs information (title, description, tags, etc.). |
| **Auto Translation** | Automatically translates the bound information (title, description, tags, etc.) into your preferred language.<br>The translation language is based on the **STT Engine Language** setting below. |
| **Template Selection** | Predefines the structure of your project.<br>You can choose between **Empty Project / Mini Game / Multi-track** templates. |
| **Tags and Description** | Add tags or detailed descriptions for your project. When imported from DLsite, these fields are filled automatically. |
| **Play Mode** | Select the basic play style.<br>‚ë† **Hand Only** ‚ë° **Device Recommended** ‚ë¢ **Device Only** |
| **Language Setting (STT Engine)** | Specify the default language used for speech recognition (STT) within the project.<br>Examples: Japanese (`ja`), English (`en`), Korean (`ko`), etc. |
| **Microphone Check Window** | When checked, a **Microphone Detection Window** appears at the project start.<br>You can test whether the input device is functioning properly. |

> üí° **Tip:**  
> Information loaded via a DLsite product code is automatically saved when the project is created.  
> Translations applied via the translation button are reflected immediately.  
> The language setting applies not only to the **STT Engine**, but also to **auto translation, subtitle generation, and TTS synthesis**.
